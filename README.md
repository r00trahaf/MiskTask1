# 📺 STC TV User Behavior Analysis & Recommendation System

This repository contains an end-to-end data science project done as part of the STC TV virtual internship program by Misk. The objective was to analyze user behavior on the STC TV platform and use data-driven approaches to improve content delivery and recommendation quality.

## 📌 Project Goals

### ✅ Task 1: Viewer Classification & Behavior Analysis
- Analyze user behavior based on program class (e.g., movies vs. series).
- Identify viewing patterns based on quality preferences (HD vs SD).
- Perform data cleaning and descriptive analysis including:
  - Mean, Standard Deviation, Min, and Max
- Visualize distributions and user behaviors to support strategic decisions.

### ✅ Task 2: Time Series Forecasting
- Build a model to **predict user viewership for the next 2 months**.
- Identify peak viewership periods to enhance infrastructure and content planning.
- Use Facebook Prophet for time series forecasting.
- Output includes:
  - Forecast graph
  - Top low-viewership days
  - Observations on viewing trends

### ✅ Task 3: Recommendation System
- Build a content-based and collaborative filtering recommendation model.
- Use user ratings and interactions to suggest relevant programs.
- Output:
  - A trained KNN and SVD model using user-program interaction matrix.
  - Display top 5 recommended programs for users who watched *Moana*.
